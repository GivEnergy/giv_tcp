and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [2.3.1] - 2023-06-30
### Fixed
- REST api fixed to correct (dis)charge timeslot error
- Corrected Config page to clarify the Inverter_AC_X setting applies to all invertoers on "old" firmware

## [2.3] - 2023-06-29
### Breaking Change
- Inverter_Max_Rate now called Inverter_Max_Bat_Rate

### Fixed
- Upped maxBatPower to 8000 to account for AIO
- fix for Eco mode setting (when moving from Eco (Paused)) Thanks Ed-M72
- MQTT fix for retained topics (Thanks BrianUK6)
- Improved monitoring of failed write commands and associated logging
- soc_kWh state_class changed to 
- Inverter Scanning improved to determine inverter type pre-config (doesn't affect config yet...)
- Setting Charge Target to values below 4 or above 100 now force those max/min values
- Day/Night costs fixed
- Export rate now updates when ENV/Config is set
- 
### Added
- New Controls available for beta firmware:
  - Local Control Mode: Sets priority for Battery, Grid or Load
  - PV Input Mode: Sets MPPT tracking to 1x2 or Independent
  - Battery Pause Mode: Forces pause of Charge, Discharge or Both
  - Gen2 inverters now have access to 10 charge and discharge slots
- Inverter_Max_Inv_Rate added as new "Inverter Details" entity
- New ENV/Config item Inverter_AC_X - Only turn this on if you have an AC inverter on "old" firmware and you get errors on startup 
- MQTT changes to cope properly when run in docker (and not in Addon/HA)

## [2.2.4] - 2023-07-14

## [2.2.2] - 2023-07-03
### Fixed
- Fixed charge target bug (Thanks S0ckhamster)

## [2.2.1] - 2023-06-29
### Fixed
- Invertor Mode calculation
- Fixed Inverer Time entity
### Added
- Work in progress compatability with the new GE AIO device (no battery data yet) - Beta testers needed

- Charge and Discharge time remaining entities (mins till full charge/discharge at current power rate) and absolute time to hit Target SOC/Battery Reserve
- Gen 3 invertors now recognised
- MQTT Auto recognition. If using the Mosquitto addon in HA it will now auto connect, removing need for MQTT configuration before running
- Refactored Write.py to always use the Redis Queue, to remove contention on modbus comms and create more reliable control signals
- Configurable retries on write commands to allow for installations with less reliable comms (Thanks @Ed-M72)
- Modified givenergy-modbus library to allow single timeslot control, to allow better integration with select controls in HA
- Individual timeslot start/end control, to remove race condition for setting start and end together
