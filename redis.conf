#
# ~~~ WARNING ~~~ If the computer running Redis is directly exposed to the

# will only be able to accept client connections from the same host that it is

# appendfsync no

# When the AOF fsync policy is set to always or everysec, and a background
# saving process (a background save or AOF log background rewriting) is
# performing a lot of I/O against the disk, in some Linux configurations
# Redis may block too long on the fsync() call. Note that there is no fix for
# this currently, as even performing fsync in a different thread will block
# our synchronous write(2) call.
#
# In order to mitigate this problem it's possible to use the following option
# that will prevent fsync() from being called in the main process while a
# BGSAVE or BGREWRITEAOF is in progress.
#
# This means that while another child is saving, the durability of Redis is
# the same as "appendfsync none". In practical terms, this means that it is
# possible to lose up to 30 seconds of log in the worst scenario (with the
# default Linux settings).
#
# If you have latency problems turn this to "yes". Otherwise leave it as
# "no" that is the safest pick from the point of view of durability.

# Automatic rewrite of the append only file.
# Redis is able to automatically rewrite the log file implicitly calling
# BGREWRITEAOF when the AOF log size grows by the specified percentage.
#
# This is how it works: Redis remembers the size of the AOF file after the
# latest rewrite (if no rewrite has happened since the restart, the size of
# the AOF at startup is used).
#
# This base size is compared to the current size. If the current size is
# bigger than the specified percentage, the rewrite is triggered. Also
# you need to specify a minimal size for the AOF file to be rewritten, this
# is useful to avoid rewriting the AOF file even if the percentage increase
# is reached but it is still pretty small.
#
# Specify a percentage of zero in order to disable the automatic AOF
# rewrite feature.

# An AOF file may be found to be truncated at the end during the Redis
# startup process, when the AOF data gets loaded back into memory.
# This may happen when the system where Redis is running
# crashes, especially when an ext4 filesystem is mounted without the
# data=ordered option (however this can't happen when Redis itself
# crashes or aborts but the operating system still works correctly).
#
# Redis can either exit with an error when this happens, or load as much
# data as possible (the default now) and start if the AOF file is found
# to be truncated at the end. The following option controls this behavior.
#
# If aof-load-truncated is set to yes, a truncated AOF file is loaded and
# the Redis server starts emitting a log to inform the user of the event.
# Otherwise if the option is set to no, the server aborts with an error
# and refuses to start. When the option is set to no, the user requires
# to fix the AOF file using the "redis-check-aof" utility before to restart
# the server.
#
# Note that if the AOF file will be found to be corrupted in the middle
# the server will still exit with an error. This option only applies when
# Redis will try to read more data from the AOF file but not enough bytes
# will be found.
aof-load-truncated yes

# When rewriting the AOF file, Redis is able to use an RDB preamble in the
# AOF file for faster rewrites and recoveries. When this option is turned
# on the rewritten AOF file is composed of two different stanzas:
#
#   [RDB file][AOF tail]
#
# When loading, Redis recognizes that the AOF file starts with the "REDIS"
# string and loads the prefixed RDB file, then continues loading the AOF
# tail.

################################ LUA SCRIPTING  ###############################

#
# When a long running script exceeds the maximum execution time only the

# used to stop a script that did not yet call any write commands. The second
# is the only way to shut down the server in the case a write command was
# already issued by the script but the user doesn't want to wait for the natural
# termination of the script.

################################ REDIS CLUSTER  ###############################

# Normal Redis instances can't be part of a Redis Cluster; only nodes that are
# started as cluster nodes can. In order to start a Redis instance as a
# cluster node enable the cluster support uncommenting the following:
#
# cluster-enabled yes

# Every cluster node has a cluster configuration file. This file is not
# intended to be edited by hand. It is created and updated by Redis nodes.
# Every Redis Cluster node requires a different cluster configuration file.
# Make sure that instances running in the same system do not have
# overlapping cluster configuration file names.
#
# cluster-config-file nodes-6379.conf

# Cluster node timeout is the amount of milliseconds a node must be unreachable
# for it to be considered in failure state.
# Most other internal time limits are a multiple of the node timeout.
#
# cluster-node-timeout 15000

# A replica of a failing master will avoid to start a failover if its data
# looks too old.
#
# There is no simple way for a replica to actually have an exact measure of
# its "data age", so the following two checks are performed:
#
# 1) If there are multiple replicas able to failover, they exchange messages
#    in order to try to give an advantage to the replica with the best
#    replication offset (more data from the master processed).
#    Replicas will try to get their rank by offset, and apply to the start
#    of the failover a delay proportional to their rank.
#
# 2) Every single replica computes the time of the last interaction with
#    its master. This can be the last ping or command received (if the master
#    is still in the "connected" state), or the time that elapsed since the
#    disconnection with the master (if the replication link is currently down).
#    If the last interaction is too old, the replica will not try to failover
#    at all.
#
# The point "2" can be tuned by user. Specifically a replica will not perform
# the failover if, since the last interaction with the master, the time
# elapsed is greater than:
#
#   (node-timeout * cluster-replica-validity-factor) + repl-ping-replica-period
#
# So for example if node-timeout is 30 seconds, and the cluster-replica-validity-factor
# is 10, and assuming a default repl-ping-replica-period of 10 seconds, the
# replica will not try to failover if it was not able to talk with the master
# for longer than 310 seconds.
#
# A large cluster-replica-validity-factor may allow replicas with too old data to failover
# a master, while a too small value may prevent the cluster from being able to
# elect a replica at all.
#
# For maximum availability, it is possible to set the cluster-replica-validity-factor
# to a value of 0, which means, that replicas will always try to failover the
# master regardless of the last time they interacted with the master.
# (However they'll always try to apply a delay proportional to their
# offset rank).
#
# Zero is the only value able to guarantee that when all the partitions heal
# the cluster will always be able to continue.
#
# cluster-replica-validity-factor 10

# Cluster replicas are able to migrate to orphaned masters, that are masters
# that are left without working replicas. This improves the cluster ability
# to resist to failures as otherwise an orphaned master can't be failed over
# in case of failure if it has no working replicas.
#
# Replicas migrate to orphaned masters only if there are still at least a
# given number of other working replicas for their old master. This number
# is the "migration barrier". A migration barrier of 1 means that a replica
# will migrate only if there is at least 1 other working replica for its master
# and so forth. It usually reflects the number of replicas you want for every
# master in your cluster.
#
# Default is 1 (replicas migrate only if their masters remain with at least
# one replica). To disable migration just set it to a very large value or
# set cluster-allow-replica-migration to 'no'.
# A value of 0 can be set but is useful only for debugging and dangerous
# in production.
#
# cluster-migration-barrier 1

# Turning off this option allows to use less automatic cluster configuration.
# It both disables migration to orphaned masters and migration from masters
# that became empty.
#
# Default is 'yes' (allow automatic migrations).
#
# cluster-allow-replica-migration yes

# By default Redis Cluster nodes stop accepting queries if they detect there
# is at least a hash slot uncovered (no available node is serving it).
# This way if the cluster is partially down (for example a range of hash slots
# are no longer covered) all the cluster becomes, eventually, unavailable.
# It automatically returns available as soon as all the slots are covered again.
#
# However sometimes you want the subset of the cluster which is working,
# to continue to accept queries for the part of the key space that is still
# covered. In order to do so, just set the cluster-require-full-coverage
# option to no.
#
# cluster-require-full-coverage yes

# This option, when set to yes, prevents replicas from trying to failover its
# master during master failures. However the replica can still perform a
# manual failover, if forced to do so.
#
# This is useful in different scenarios, especially in the case of multiple
# data center operations, where we want one side to never be promoted if not
# in the case of a total DC failure.
#
# cluster-replica-no-failover no

# This option, when set to yes, allows nodes to serve read traffic while the
# the cluster is in a down state, as long as it believes it owns the slots. 
#
# This is useful for two cases.  The first case is for when an application 
# doesn't require consistency of data during node failures or network partitions.
# One example of this is a cache, where as long as the node has the data it
# should be able to serve it. 
#
# The second use case is for configurations that don't meet the recommended  
# three shards but want to enable cluster mode and scale later. A 
# master outage in a 1 or 2 shard configuration causes a read/write outage to the
# entire cluster without this option set, with it set there is only a write outage.
# Without a quorum of masters, slot ownership will not change automatically. 
#
# cluster-allow-reads-when-down no

# In order to setup your cluster make sure to read the documentation
# available at https://redis.io web site.

########################## CLUSTER DOCKER/NAT support  ########################

# In certain deployments, Redis Cluster nodes address discovery fails, because
# addresses are NAT-ted or because ports are forwarded (the typical case is
# Docker and other containers).
#
# In order to make Redis Cluster working in such environments, a static
# configuration where each node knows its public address is needed. The
# following four options are used for this scope, and are:
#
# * cluster-announce-ip
# * cluster-announce-port
# * cluster-announce-tls-port
# * cluster-announce-bus-port
#
# Each instructs the node about its address, client ports (for connections
# without and with TLS) and cluster message bus port. The information is then
# published in the header of the bus packets so that other nodes will be able to
# correctly map the address of the node publishing the information.
#
# If cluster-tls is set to yes and cluster-announce-tls-port is omitted or set
# to zero, then cluster-announce-port refers to the TLS port. Note also that
# cluster-announce-tls-port has no effect if cluster-tls is set to no.
#
# If the above options are not used, the normal Redis Cluster auto-detection
# will be used instead.
#
# Note that when remapped, the bus port may not be at the fixed offset of
# clients port + 10000, so you can specify any port and bus-port depending
# on how they get remapped. If the bus-port is not set, a fixed offset of
# 10000 will be used as usual.
#
# Example:
#
# cluster-announce-ip 10.1.1.5
# cluster-announce-tls-port 6379
# cluster-announce-port 0
# cluster-announce-bus-port 6380

################################## SLOW LOG ###################################

# The Redis Slow Log is a system to log queries that exceeded a specified
# execution time. The execution time does not include the I/O operations
# like talking with the client, sending the reply and so forth,
# but just the time needed to actually execute the command (this is the only
# stage of command execution where the thread is blocked and can not serve
# other requests in the meantime).
#
# You can configure the slow log with two parameters: one tells Redis
# what is the execution time, in microseconds, to exceed in order for the
# command to get logged, and the other parameter is the length of the
# slow log. When a new command is logged the oldest one is removed from the
# queue of logged commands.

# The following time is expressed in microseconds, so 1000000 is equivalent
# to one second. Note that a negative number disables the slow log, while
# a value of zero forces the logging of every command.
slowlog-log-slower-than 10000

# There is no limit to this length. Just be aware that it will consume memory.
# You can reclaim memory used by the slow log with SLOWLOG RESET.
slowlog-max-len 128

################################ LATENCY MONITOR ##############################

# The Redis latency monitoring subsystem samples different operations
# at runtime in order to collect data related to possible sources of
# latency of a Redis instance.
#
# Via the LATENCY command this information is available to the user that can
# print graphs and obtain reports.
#
# The system only logs operations that were performed in a time equal or
# greater than the amount of milliseconds specified via the
# latency-monitor-threshold configuration directive. When its value is set
# to zero, the latency monitor is turned off.
#
# By default latency monitoring is disabled since it is mostly not needed
# if you don't have latency issues, and collecting data has a performance
# impact, that while very small, can be measured under big load. Latency
# monitoring can easily be enabled at runtime using the command
# "CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold <milliseconds>" if needed.
latency-monitor-threshold 0

############################# EVENT NOTIFICATION ##############################

# Redis can notify Pub/Sub clients about events happening in the key space.
# This feature is documented at https://redis.io/topics/notifications
#
# For instance if keyspace events notification is enabled, and a client
# performs a DEL operation on key "foo" stored in the Database 0, two
# messages will be published via Pub/Sub:
#
# PUBLISH __keyspace@0__:foo del
# PUBLISH __keyevent@0__:del foo
#
# It is possible to select the events that Redis will notify among a set
# of classes. Every class is identified by a single character:
#
#  K     Keyspace events, published with __keyspace@<db>__ prefix.
#  E     Keyevent events, published with __keyevent@<db>__ prefix.
#  g     Generic commands (non-type specific) like DEL, EXPIRE, RENAME, ...
#  $     String commands
#  l     List commands
#  s     Set commands
#  h     Hash commands
#  z     Sorted set commands
#  x     Expired events (events generated every time a key expires)
#  e     Evicted events (events generated when a key is evicted for maxmemory)
#  t     Stream commands
#  d     Module key type events
#  m     Key-miss events (Note: It is not included in the 'A' class)
#  A     Alias for g$lshzxetd, so that the "AKE" string means all the events
#        (Except key-miss events which are excluded from 'A' due to their
#         unique nature).
#
#  The "notify-keyspace-events" takes as argument a string that is composed
#  of zero or multiple characters. The empty string means that notifications
#  are disabled.
#
#  Example: to enable list and generic events, from the point of view of the
#           event name, use:
#
#  notify-keyspace-events Elg
#
#  Example 2: to get the stream of the expired keys subscribing to channel
#             name __keyevent@0__:expired use:
#
#  notify-keyspace-events Ex
#
#  By default all notifications are disabled because most users don't need
#  this feature and the feature has some overhead. Note that if you don't
#  specify at least one of K or E, no events will be delivered.
notify-keyspace-events ""

############################### GOPHER SERVER #################################

# Redis contains an implementation of the Gopher protocol, as specified in
# the RFC 1436 (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1436.txt).
#
# The Gopher protocol was very popular in the late '90s. It is an alternative
# to the web, and the implementation both server and client side is so simple
# that the Redis server has just 100 lines of code in order to implement this
# support.
#
# What do you do with Gopher nowadays? Well Gopher never *really* died, and
# lately there is a movement in order for the Gopher more hierarchical content
# composed of just plain text documents to be resurrected. Some want a simpler
# internet, others believe that the mainstream internet became too much
# controlled, and it's cool to create an alternative space for people that
# want a bit of fresh air.
#
# Anyway for the 10nth birthday of the Redis, we gave it the Gopher protocol
# as a gift.
#
# --- HOW IT WORKS? ---
#
# The Redis Gopher support uses the inline protocol of Redis, and specifically
# two kind of inline requests that were anyway illegal: an empty request
# or any request that starts with "/" (there are no Redis commands starting
# with such a slash). Normal RESP2/RESP3 requests are completely out of the
# path of the Gopher protocol implementation and are served as usual as well.
#
# If you open a connection to Redis when Gopher is enabled and send it
# a string like "/foo", if there is a key named "/foo" it is served via the
# Gopher protocol.
#
# In order to create a real Gopher "hole" (the name of a Gopher site in Gopher
# talking), you likely need a script like the following:
#
#   https://github.com/antirez/gopher2redis
#
# --- SECURITY WARNING ---
#
# If you plan to put Redis on the internet in a publicly accessible address
# to server Gopher pages MAKE SURE TO SET A PASSWORD to the instance.
# Once a password is set:
#
#   1. The Gopher server (when enabled, not by default) will still serve
#      content via Gopher.
#   2. However other commands cannot be called before the client will
#      authenticate.
#
# So use the 'requirepass' option to protect your instance.
#
# Note that Gopher is not currently supported when 'io-threads-do-reads'
# is enabled.
#
# To enable Gopher support, uncomment the following line and set the option
# from no (the default) to yes.
#
# gopher-enabled no

############################### ADVANCED CONFIG ###############################

# Hashes are encoded using a memory efficient data structure when they have a
# small number of entries, and the biggest entry does not exceed a given
# threshold. These thresholds can be configured using the following directives.
hash-max-ziplist-entries 512
hash-max-ziplist-value 64

# Lists are also encoded in a special way to save a lot of space.
# The number of entries allowed per internal list node can be specified
# as a fixed maximum size or a maximum number of elements.
# For a fixed maximum size, use -5 through -1, meaning:
# -5: max size: 64 Kb  <-- not recommended for normal workloads
# -4: max size: 32 Kb  <-- not recommended
# -3: max size: 16 Kb  <-- probably not recommended
# -2: max size: 8 Kb   <-- good
# -1: max size: 4 Kb   <-- good
# Positive numbers mean store up to _exactly_ that number of elements
# per list node.
# The highest performing option is usually -2 (8 Kb size) or -1 (4 Kb size),
# but if your use case is unique, adjust the settings as necessary.
list-max-ziplist-size -2

# Lists may also be compressed.
# Compress depth is the number of quicklist ziplist nodes from *each* side of
# the list to *exclude* from compression.  The head and tail of the list
# are always uncompressed for fast push/pop operations.  Settings are:
# 0: disable all list compression
# 1: depth 1 means "don't start compressing until after 1 node into the list,
#    going from either the head or tail"
#    So: [head]->node->node->...->node->[tail]
#    [head], [tail] will always be uncompressed; inner nodes will compress.
# 2: [head]->[next]->node->node->...->node->[prev]->[tail]
#    2 here means: don't compress head or head->next or tail->prev or tail,
#    but compress all nodes between them.
# 3: [head]->[next]->[next]->node->node->...->node->[prev]->[prev]->[tail]
# etc.

# Sets have a special encoding in just one case: when a set is composed
# of just strings that happen to be integers in radix 10 in the range
# of 64 bit signed integers.
# The following configuration setting sets the limit in the size of the
# set in order to use this special memory saving encoding.
set-max-intset-entries 512

# Similarly to hashes and lists, sorted sets are also specially encoded in
# order to save a lot of space. This encoding is only used when the length and
# elements of a sorted set are below the following limits:
zset-max-ziplist-entries 128
zset-max-ziplist-value 64

# HyperLogLog sparse representation bytes limit. The limit includes the
# 16 bytes header. When an HyperLogLog using the sparse representation crosses
# this limit, it is converted into the dense representation.
#
# A value greater than 16000 is totally useless, since at that point the
# dense representation is more memory efficient.
#
# The suggested value is ~ 3000 in order to have the benefits of
# the space efficient encoding without slowing down too much PFADD,
# which is O(N) with the sparse encoding. The value can be raised to
# ~ 10000 when CPU is not a concern, but space is, and the data set is
# composed of many HyperLogLogs with cardinality in the 0 - 15000 range.
hll-sparse-max-bytes 3000

# Streams macro node max size / items. The stream data structure is a radix
# tree of big nodes that encode multiple items inside. Using this configuration
# it is possible to configure how big a single node can be in bytes, and the
# maximum number of items it may contain before switching to a new node when
# appending new stream entries. If any of the following settings are set to
# zero, the limit is ignored, so for instance it is possible to set just a
# max entries limit by setting max-bytes to 0 and max-entries to the desired
# value.

# Active rehashing uses 1 millisecond every 100 milliseconds of CPU time in
# order to help rehashing the main Redis hash table (the one mapping top-level
# keys to values). The hash table implementation Redis uses (see dict.c)
# performs a lazy rehashing: the more operation you run into a hash table
# that is rehashing, the more rehashing "steps" are performed, so if the
# server is idle the rehashing is never complete and some more memory is used
# by the hash table.
#
# The default is to use this millisecond 10 times every second in order to
# actively rehash the main dictionaries, freeing memory when possible.
#
# If unsure:
# use "activerehashing no" if you have hard latency requirements and it is
# not a good thing in your environment that Redis can reply from time to time
# to queries with 2 milliseconds delay.
#
# use "activerehashing yes" if you don't have such hard requirements but
# want to free memory asap when possible.

# The client output buffer limits can be used to force disconnection of clients
# that are not reading data from the server fast enough for some reason (a
# common reason is that a Pub/Sub client can't consume messages as fast as the
# publisher can produce them).
#
# The limit can be set differently for the three different classes of clients:
#
# normal -> normal clients including MONITOR clients
# replica  -> replica clients
# pubsub -> clients subscribed to at least one pubsub channel or pattern
#
# The syntax of every client-output-buffer-limit directive is the following:
#
# client-output-buffer-limit <class> <hard limit> <soft limit> <soft seconds>
#
# A client is immediately disconnected once the hard limit is reached, or if
# the soft limit is reached and remains reached for the specified number of
# seconds (continuously).
# So for instance if the hard limit is 32 megabytes and the soft limit is
# 16 megabytes / 10 seconds, the client will get disconnected immediately
# if the size of the output buffers reach 32 megabytes, but will also get
# disconnected if the client reaches 16 megabytes and continuously overcomes
# the limit for 10 seconds.
#
# By default normal clients are not limited because they don't receive data
# without asking (in a push way), but just after a request, so only
# asynchronous clients may create a scenario where data is requested faster
# than it can read.
#
# Instead there is a default limit for pubsub and replica clients, since
# subscribers and replicas receive data in a push fashion.
#
# Both the hard or the soft limit can be disabled by setting them to zero.

# needs, such us huge multi/exec requests or alike.

# In the Redis protocol, bulk requests, that are, elements representing single

# Redis calls an internal function to perform many background tasks, like
# closing connections of clients in timeout, purging expired keys that are
# never requested, and so forth.
#
# Not all tasks are performed with the same frequency, but Redis checks for
# tasks to perform according to the specified "hz" value.
#
# By default "hz" is set to 10. Raising the value will use more CPU when
# Redis is idle, but at the same time will make Redis more responsive when
# there are many keys expiring at the same time, and timeouts may be
# handled with more precision.
#
# The range is between 1 and 500, however a value over 100 is usually not
# a good idea. Most users should use the default of 10 and raise this up to

hz 10

# Normally it is useful to have an HZ value which is proportional to the
# number of clients connected. This is useful in order, for instance, to
# avoid too many clients are processed for each background task invocation
# in order to avoid latency spikes.
#
# Since the default HZ value by default is conservatively set to 10, Redis
# offers, and enables by default, the ability to use an adaptive HZ value
# which will temporarily raise when there are many connected clients.
#
# When dynamic HZ is enabled, the actual configured HZ will be used
# as a baseline, but multiples of the configured HZ value will be actually
# used as needed once more clients are connected. In this way an idle
# instance will use very little CPU time while a busy instance will be
# more responsive.
dynamic-hz yes

# When a child rewrites the AOF file, if the following option is enabled

# Redis LFU eviction (see maxmemory setting) can be tuned. However it is a good
# idea to start with the default settings and only change them after investigating
# how to improve the performances and how the keys LFU change over time, which
# is possible to inspect via the OBJECT FREQ command.
#
# There are two tunable parameters in the Redis LFU implementation: the
# counter logarithm factor and the counter decay time. It is important to
# understand what the two parameters mean before changing them.
#
# The LFU counter is just 8 bits per key, it's maximum value is 255, so Redis
# uses a probabilistic increment with logarithmic behavior. Given the value
# of the old counter, when a key is accessed, the counter is incremented in
# this way:
#
# 1. A random number R between 0 and 1 is extracted.
# 2. A probability P is calculated as 1/(old_value*lfu_log_factor+1).
# 3. The counter is incremented only if R < P.
#
# The default lfu-log-factor is 10. This is a table of how the frequency
# counter changes with a different number of accesses with different
# logarithmic factors:
#
# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
# | factor | 100 hits   | 1000 hits  | 100K hits  | 1M hits    | 10M hits   |
# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
# | 0      | 104        | 255        | 255        | 255        | 255        |
# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
# | 1      | 18         | 49         | 255        | 255        | 255        |
# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
# | 10     | 10         | 18         | 142        | 255        | 255        |
# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
# | 100    | 8          | 11         | 49         | 143        | 255        |
# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
#
# NOTE: The above table was obtained by running the following commands:
#
#   redis-benchmark -n 1000000 incr foo
#   redis-cli object freq foo
#
# NOTE 2: The counter initial value is 5 in order to give new objects a chance
# to accumulate hits.
#
# The counter decay time is the time, in minutes, that must elapse in order
# for the key counter to be divided by two (or decremented if it has a value
# less <= 10).
#
# The default value for the lfu-decay-time is 1. A special value of 0 means to
# decay the counter every time it happens to be scanned.

########################### ACTIVE DEFRAGMENTATION #######################
#
# What is active defragmentation?
# -------------------------------
#
# Active (online) defragmentation allows a Redis server to compact the
# spaces left between small allocations and deallocations of data in memory,
# thus allowing to reclaim back memory.
#
# Fragmentation is a natural process that happens with every allocator (but
# less so with Jemalloc, fortunately) and certain workloads. Normally a server
# restart is needed in order to lower the fragmentation, or at least to flush
# away all the data and create it again. However thanks to this feature
# implemented by Oran Agra for Redis 4.0 this process can happen at runtime
# in a "hot" way, while the server is running.
#
# Basically when the fragmentation is over a certain level (see the
# configuration options below) Redis will start to create new copies of the
# values in contiguous memory regions by exploiting certain specific Jemalloc
# features (in order to understand if an allocation is causing fragmentation
# and to allocate it in a better place), and at the same time, will release the
# old copies of the data. This process, repeated incrementally for all the keys
# will cause the fragmentation to drop back to normal values.
#
# Important things to understand:
#
# 1. This feature is disabled by default, and only works if you compiled Redis
#    to use the copy of Jemalloc we ship with the source code of Redis.
#    This is the default with Linux builds.
#
# 2. You never need to enable this feature if you don't have fragmentation
#    issues.
#
# 3. Once you experience fragmentation, you can enable this feature when
#    needed with the command "CONFIG SET activedefrag yes".
#
# The configuration parameters are able to fine tune the behavior of the
# defragmentation process. If you are not sure about what they mean it is
# a good idea to leave the defaults untouched.

# It is possible to pin different threads and processes of Redis to specific
# CPUs in your system, in order to maximize the performances of the server.
# This is useful both in order to pin different Redis threads in different
# CPUs, but also in order to make sure that multiple Redis instances running
# in the same host will be pinned to different CPUs.
#
# Normally you can do this using the "taskset" command, however it is also
# possible to this via Redis configuration directly, both in Linux and FreeBSD.
#
# You can pin the server/IO threads, bio threads, aof rewrite child process, and
# the bgsave child process. The syntax to specify the cpu list is the same as
# the taskset command:
#
# Set redis server/io threads to cpu affinity 0,2,4,6:
# server_cpulist 0-7:2
#
# Set bio threads to cpu affinity 1,3:
# bio_cpulist 1,3
#
# Set aof rewrite child process to cpu affinity 8,9,10,11:
# aof_rewrite_cpulist 8-11
#
# Set bgsave child process to cpu affinity 1,10,11
# bgsave_cpulist 1,10-11

# In some cases redis will emit warnings and even refuse to start if it detects
# that the system is in bad state, it is possible to suppress these warnings
# by setting the following config which takes a space delimited list of warnings
# to suppress
#
# ignore-warnings ARM64-COW-BUG
