# GivTCP
## TCP Modbus connection to MQTT/JSON for GivEnergy Battery/PV Invertors

This project opens a connection to the GivEnergy invertors via TCP Modbus. Access is given through the native Wifi/Ethernet dongle and can be connected via either LAN or directly through the inbuilt SSID AP.

The basis of this project is a connection to the Modbus TCP server which runs on the wifi dongle. All you need is run the script on the same network. The following is needed to make it work:
* GivEnergy Invertor that is commissioned and online.
* IP address of the invertor


## Docker
You can find the Docker container repo here: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/britkat/giv_tcp-ma
This will set up a self-running service which will publish data as required and provide a REST interface for control. An internal MQTT broker can be activiated to make data avalable on the network.
 
* Docker image is multi-architecture so docker should grab the correct version for your system (tested on x86 and rpi3)
* Create a container with the relevant ENV variables below (mimicing the settings.py file)
* Set the container to auto-restart to ensure reliability
* Out of the box the default setup enables local MQTT broker and REST service (see below for details)
* Configuration via ENV as outlined below

Installation via the docker-compose.yml file is recommended if not running through the Home Assistant add-on.

## Home Assistant Add-on
This container can also be used as an add-on in Home Assistant.
The add-on requires an existing MQTT broker such as Mosquito, also available to install from the Add-on store.
To install GivTCP as an add-on, add this repository (https://github.com/britkat1980/giv_tcp) to the Add-on Store repository list.
The following configuration items are mandatory before the add-on can be started:
* Inverter IP address
* MQTT username (can also be a Home Assistant user - used to authenticate againt your MQTT broker)
* MQTT password
All other configuration items can be left as-is unless you need to change them. See the ENV below for full details

### Home Assistant Usage
GivTCP will automatically create Home Assistant devices if "HA_AUTO_D" setting is True. This does require MQTT_OUTPUT to also be true and for GivTCP to publish its data to the same MQTT broker as HA is listening to.
This will populate HA with all devices and entities for control and monitoring. The key entities and their usage are outlined below:

## GivTCP Read data

GivTCP collects all inverter and battery data through the "runAll" function. It creates a nested data structure with all data available in a structured format.
Data Elements are:
* Energy - Today and all-time Total
    * Today
    * Total
* Power - Real-time stats and power flow data
    * Power stats (eg. Import)
    * Power Flow (eg. Grid to House)
* Inverter Details - Status details such as Serial Number
* Timeslots - Charge and Discharge
* Control - Charge/Discharge rates, Battery SOC
* Battery Details - Status and real-time cell voltages
    * Battery 1
    * Battery 2
    * ...

| Function      | Description                                                                        | REST URL  |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| getData       | This connects to the inverter, collects all data and stores a cache for publishing | /getData  |
| readData      | Retrieves data from the local cache and publishes data according to the settings   | /readData |
| getCache      | Retrieves data from the local cache returns it without publishing to MQTT etc...   | /getCache |
| RunAll        | Runs both getData and pubFromPickle to refresh data and then publish               | /runAll   |

If you have enabled the "SELF_RUN" setting (recommended) then the container/add-on will automatically call "RunALL" every "SELF_LOOPTIMER" seconds and you will not need to use the REST commands here. If you wish to take data from GivTCP and push to another system, then you should call "getCache" which will return the json data without pushing to MQTT or other defined publish settings.

## Usage methods:
GivTCP data and control is generally available through two core methods. If you are using the Home Assistant Add-On then these are generally transparent to the user, but are working and available in the background.

### MQTT
By setting MQTT_OUTPUT = True, the script will publish directly to the nominated MQTT broker (MQTT_ADDRESS) all the requested read data.

Data is published to "GivEnergy/<serial_number>/" by default or you can nominate a specific root topic by setting "MQTT_TOPIC" in the settings.

<img width="245" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69121158/149670766-0d9a6c92-8ee2-44d6-9045-2d21b6db7ebf.png">

Control is available using MQTT. By publishing data to the same MQTT broker as above you can trigger the control methods as per the above table.
Root topic for control is:
"GivEnergy/<serial_number>/control/"    - Default
"<MQTT_TOPIC>/<serial_number>/control/" - If MQTT_TOPIC is set

### RESTful Service
GivTCP provides a wrapper function REST.py which uses Flask to expose the read and control functions as RESTful http calls. To utilise this service you will need to either use a WSGI service such as gunicorn or use the pre-built Docker container.

If Docker is running in Host mode then the REST service is available on port 6345

### Prometheus Exporter
To make use of the Prometheus exporter you will need to have a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) server configured.

By setting `PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER` to `True` the `prometheus_exporter.py` script will be executed for each inverter, with the first listening on the value of `PROMETHEUS_PORT`.

You can see the metrics exported by visiting http://localhost:6711/metrics

You will need to update your Prometheus server's configuration to scrape the metrics from the exporter. An example is shown below:

```yaml
  - job_name: 'giv_energy'
    static_configs:
      - targets: [ 'localhost:6711' ]
```

You can then visualise the metrics using [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for example.
