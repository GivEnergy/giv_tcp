# GivTCP
## TCP Modbus connection to MQTT/JSON for Givenergy Battery/PV Invertors

This project opens a connection to the GivEnergy invertors via TCP Modbus. Access is given through the native Wifi/Ethernet dongle and can be connected via either LAN or directly through the inbuilt SSID AP.

The basis of this project is a connection to the Modbus TCP server which runs on the wifi dongle. All you need is run the script on the same network. The following is needed to make it work:
* GivEnergy Invertor that is commissioned and online.
* IP address of the invertor


## Docker
You can find the Docker container repo here: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/britkat/giv_tcp-ma
This will set up a self-running service which will publish data as required and provide a REST interface for control. An internal MQTT broker can be activiated to make data avalable on the network.
  
* Docker image is multi-architecture so docker should grab the correct version for your system (tested on x86 and rpi3)
* Create a container with the relevant ENV variables below (mimicing the settings.py file)
* Set the container to auto-restart to ensure reliability
* From out of the box, the default setup enables local MQTT broker and REST service (see below for details)
* For Invertor autodiscovery to function, your container must run on the "Host" network within docker (not Bridge). If it fails then you will need to manually add in INVERTOR_IP to the env variables

### Installation
The simplist installation method for GivTCP is to use the built-in self-run option which will automatically connect to your invertor and grab the data.

1. Install docker on a suitable machine which is "always on" in your network.
2. Open up your docker interface (I prefer portainer https://www.portainer.io/)
3. Navigate to "Stacks" and click "Add Stack"
4. Copy the contents of the docker-compose.yml file in this repo into the web editor pane
5. Scoll down to the "Advanced container settings" and select the Env tab
6. Edit any settings you wish. Specifically the INVERTOR_IP
   1. See the below table for other optional variables which you can also use.
7. Deploy the container

Alternatively you can run the container from the command line by downloading the docker-compose.yml file, modifying it and then run the following commmand in the same file location: "docker-compose up".

Once this has been done the container should start-up and begin publishing data to its internal MQTT broker. You can test this by using an MQTT client, such as MQTT Explorer(http://mqtt-explorer.com/) and connect using the IP address of the machine you are running docker on.

From here your invertor data is available through either MQTT or REST as described below. 

### Docker Envirnoment Variables

| ENV Name                | Example       |  Description                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------- |  -------------------------------- |
| INVERTOR_IP |192.168.10.1 | Docker container can auto detect Invertors if running on your host network. If this fails then add the IP manually to this ENV |
| NUM_BATTERIES | 1 | Number of battery units connected to the invertor |
| MQTT_OUTPUT | True | Optional if set to True then MQTT_ADDRESS is required |
| MQTT_ADDRESS | 127.0.0.1 | Optional (but required if OUTPUT is set to MQTT) |
| MQTT_USERNAME | bob | Optional |
| MQTT_PASSWORD | cat | Optional |
| MQTT_TOPIC | GivEnergy/Data | Optional - default is Givenergy.<serial number>|
| LOG_LEVEL | Error | Optional - you can choose Error, Info or Debug. Output will be sent to the debug file location if specified, otherwise it is sent to stdout|
| DEBUG_FILE_LOCATION | /usr/pi/data | Optional  |
| PRINT_RAW | False | Optional - If set to True the raw register values will be returned alongside the normal data |
| INFLUX_OUTPUT | False | Optional - Used to enable publishing of energy and power data to influx |

| INFLUX_BUCKET |giv_bucket| Optional - If using influx this is data bucket to use|
| INFLUX_ORG |giv_tcp| Optional - If using influx this is the org that the token is assigned to | 
| HA_AUTO_D | True | Optional - If set to true and MQTT is enabled, it will publish Home Assistant Auto Discovery messages, which will allow Home Assistant to automagically create all entitites and devices to allow read and control of your Invertor |
| SELF_RUN_LOOP_TIMER |10| Time in seconds to pause between inverter read cycles |

## GivTCP Read data

GivTCP collects all invertor and battery data through the "runAll" function. It creates a nested data structure with all data available in a structured format.
Data Elements are:
* Energy - Today and all-time Total
    * Today
    * Total
* Power - Real-time stats and power flow data
    * Power stats (eg. Import)
    * Power Flow (eg. Grid to House)
* Invertor Details - Status details such as Serial Number
* Timeslots - Charge and Discharge
* Control - Charge/Discharge rates, Battery SOC
* Battery Details - Status and real-time cell voltages
    * Battery 1
    * Battery 2
    * ...

## Usage methods:
### MQTT
By setting MQTT_OUTPUT = True The script will publish directly to the nominated MQTT broker (MQTT_ADDRESS) all the requested read data.

Data is published to "GivEnergy/<serial_number>/" by default or you can nominate a specific root topic by setting "MQTT_TOPIC" in the settings.

<img width="245" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69121158/149670766-0d9a6c92-8ee2-44d6-9045-2d21b6db7ebf.png">

Control is available using MQTT. By publishing data to the smae MQTT broker as above you can trigger the control methods as per the above table.
Root topic for control is:
"GivEnergy/<serial_number>/control/"    - Default
"<MQTT_TOPIC>/<serial_number>/control/" - If MQTT_TOPIC is set


### RESTful Service
GivTCP provides a wrapper function REST.py which uses Flask to expose the read and control functions as RESTful http calls. To utilise this service you will need to either use a WSGI serivce such as gunicorn or use the pre-built Docker container.

If Docker is running in Host mode then the REST service is available on port 6345

This can be used within a Node-Red flow to integrate into your automation or using Home Assistany REST sensors unsing the Home Assistant yaml package provided.
NB.This does require the Docker container running on your network.
